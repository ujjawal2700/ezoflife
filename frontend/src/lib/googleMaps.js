/**
 * Canonical Google Maps loader configuration.
 *
 * `@react-google-maps/api` loads the Maps SDK exactly once per page. Every
 * useJsApiLoader / useLoadScript call must therefore receive the SAME options
 * object — same id, same version, same libraries. If any call site differs,
 * the loader throws:
 *
 *     "Loader must not be called again with different options"
 *
 * ...and every map on the page silently fails to render.
 *
 * Two rules for call sites:
 *   1. Always spread GOOGLE_MAPS_LOADER_OPTIONS — never hand-roll the options.
 *   2. Never pass an inline array for `libraries`. A fresh array literal is a new
 *      reference on every render, which the loader reads as changed options.
